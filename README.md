#maidenhead

Converts latitude and longitude to Maidenhead grid locators.

I adapted from Ossi Väänänen's code https://ham.stackexchange.com/questions/221/how-can-one-convert-from-lat-long-to-grid-square to something more useful for me.
Test were cases lifted from https://gist.github.com/laemmy/maidenhead.py
